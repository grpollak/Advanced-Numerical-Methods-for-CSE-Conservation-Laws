    \begin{proof}[Shock Wave Solution\cref{defn:shock_wave_solution}]\label{proof:defn:shock_wave_solution}\leavevmode\\
        We know that in the absence of discontinuities the solution is given by\cref{eq:characteristics_for_sclar_conservation_laws}
        -- that is the inital data is propagated.\\
        However at the discontinuity $\flux'(u)$ is no longer well defined but we can resolve this issue by using the shock speed
        of the Rankine-Hugoniot condition\cref{eq:shock_speed} as a substitute.
