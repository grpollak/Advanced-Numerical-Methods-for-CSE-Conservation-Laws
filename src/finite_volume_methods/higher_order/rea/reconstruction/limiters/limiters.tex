    We have seen that schemes using simple finite differences for the reconstructions slope $\sigmac_{\idxj}^{n}$ are unstable and
    we know that the evolution and averaging operations are TVD\cref{cor:evolution_is_tvd,cor:evolution_is_tvd} thus we need to ensure that the reconstruction is TVD as well:
    \begin{align*}
      \text{TV}\left(\polynomial^{n}\right)\leq\text{TV} \left(u^{n}\right)
    \end{align*}
    The problem is that schemes using simple finite differences for the slope are not TVD due to discontinuities.
